## install

cran version

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("microdemic")
```

dev version

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/microdemic")
```

```{r}
library("microdemic")
```

## Evaluate

See the [query expression syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/academic-knowledge/queryexpressionsyntax)
for help on how to construct queries - for this and other functions

```{r}
ma_evaluate(query = "Y='19'...")
```

## Calchistogram

```{r}
res <- ma_calchist(query = "And(Composite(AA.AuN=='jaime teevan'),Y>2012)",
   atts = c('Y', 'F.FN'))
res$histograms$histogram
```

## Similarity

```{r}
s1 <- "Using complementary priors, we derive a fast greedy algorithm that
can learn deep directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the
top two layers form an undirected associative memory"
s2 <- "Deepneural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful
machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in
such networks"
ma_similarity(s1, s2)
```

## Abstract

```{r}
ma_abstract(query = "Y='19'...", count = 5)
```
